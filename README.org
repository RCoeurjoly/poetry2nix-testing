* Purpose
Find uninstallable pip packages and fix them
* Method
We get the file with 8k most downloaded pip packages.
Since poertry uses pip, poetry should be able to install them all.
We try to install them.
For a package <package> to be completely installable and usable, we have to be able to:
#+begin_src shell :shebang #!/bin/bash -i :results output
poetry add <package>
nix develop
#+end_src
If any of those commands fails, the package is no usable

I need to know how it failed, so that I can fix it.
The most common error y NoModuleFound

What would be the most comfortable
We have the list of installable and uninstallable packages in plot_data.dat
Packages that fail to install, ordered by download count
#+begin_src shell :shebang #!/bin/bash -i :results output
grep " 1$" plot_data.dat | awk '{print $1}'
#+end_src
